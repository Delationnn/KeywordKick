Commands:
/keywordkick - Reloads config.yml

The configuration can be found at plugins/keywordkick/config.yml

Any player with the keywordkick.bypass permission cam bypass being kicked from the proxy completely! Additionally, if a player has the keywordkick.reload permission, they can reload the configuration.
